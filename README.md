# ESRGAN-TEAM-HAMOYE-PROJECT
Data Science and Generative AI Project on Educational Infrastructure

**Project Structure**
A) **ESRGAN TEAM Jupyter Notebook**: Contains raw datasets and Python code for data cleaning, feature engineering, and k-means clustering.
  This folder contains:
  i) **"ESRGAN TEAM Project.ipynb"**: A Jupyter Notebook file containing code that executes the data loading, cleaning, feature engineering, and unsupervised machine learning.
 ii) **ESRGAN Project Datasets**: This folder contains the CSV files of the raw datasets.

B) **PowerPoint Presentation**: Contains the PowerPoint presentation slides of the ESRGAN team.
  This folder contains:
  i) **"ESRGAN TEAM'S PRESENTATION(1).pdf"**: A PDF File of the team's project presentation slides.

C) **Project Research Paper**: contains the project research document.
  This folder contains:
  i) **"ESRGAN TEAM'S RESEARCH PAPER.pdf"**: This PDF file contains the documentation of the entire project.

D) **RAG Application**: contains the code and document for the implementation of RAG in the project. RAG is an AI concept, that involves providing an AI large context in the form of a document to enable it to accurately perform tasks.
  This folder contains:
  i) **Education Data PDF Document**: This folder contains the PDF document for the RAG system:
    This folder contains:
    1) **'corrected_dataset_abriged_PDF.pdf'**: The PDF document that provides context to the LLM
    
 ii) **Requirements**: 
   This folder contains:
   1) **'requirements.txt'**: This contains the Python dependencies for creating and running the RAG Application.

iii) **'main.py'**: This Python file contains the code for the implementation of the RAG Application and the implementation of the Streamlit user interface.
